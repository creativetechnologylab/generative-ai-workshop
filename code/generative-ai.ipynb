Blue light has a shorter wavelength, so it is scattered more than the other colors of visible light, which are longer in wavelength. This makes the sky appear blue from our perspective on the ground.\n",

It usually has a playful or rhythmic feel to it and often tells a short story or conveys a light-hearted message.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the topic here is the nature of time. Time can be tricky because it's something we all experience every day but isn't tangibleâ€”it's more of an abstract concept. I guess I could approach this in different ways: maybe talking about how time moves us forward without pause, or perhaps the idea that time doesn't care who waits for it.\n",

      "\n",
      "Let me see... Maybe start with something like \"There once was a time, oh what fun,\" but wait, that doesn't fit the limerick structure. Alternatively, I could try to think of a metaphor involving movement since time often feels like it's moving forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, another thought: perhaps using the image of a river running or a child skipping stones over water because time glides by quickly. That could tie into the idea of time passing without stopping and how we don't notice it when it does go by.\n",

      "Putting that together:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There once was a river so clear,\"  \n",

      "\n",
      "Maybe something like \"Time has no bounds, it goes on and on,\" but make it rhyme. Hmm, perhaps using \"snaps through the fingers of man\" from Alice in Wonderland as a metaphor? Not sure if that's the best fit here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me try to think of some lines:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The clock ticks softly, soft as a bell,\"  \n",
      "\"But time is faster, quicker than we'll see.\"  \n",
      "But then I need more lines. Maybe add something about how it doesn't stop for anyone and how we often resist its flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe the first line could be \"Time is a thief\" or \"Time moves swiftly.\" Let me try that:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's a thief in the night, quick as can be,\"  \n",
      "\"Who steals away moments when we're not asleep.\"  \n",
      "That has rhyme and rhythm. Now for the next lines: perhaps how time doesn't wait for anyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But he takes what he wants, with little pause,\"  \n",
      "\"He leaves our days before our years can save.\"  \n",
      "Now I'm at four lines. The fifth line should wrap it up or add a twist. Maybe something like \"So hurry up and be ready\" to catch up? But that's more of a command than a statement about time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the last couplet could express a perspective on life in relation to time:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So watch the moments as they pass by,\"  \n",
      "\"Time's a trickster, always changes my way.\"  \n",
      "Hmm, not sure if that's strong enough. Let me try again with different wording for the last two lines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps something like \"Time moves on without pause, It takes what it will, and leaves its trace.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, putting it all together:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There was once a thief in the night,\"  \n",
