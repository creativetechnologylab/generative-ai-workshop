# GANs vs Diffusion Models

Two approaches to generating images...
---
# Diffusion Models

- trained on lots of data
- prompt-driven
- designed to generate anything
- text-prompt based interaction (conditional generation)
---
# Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

- trained on smaller, curated data
- generates new instances of what it has been trained on
- more trial-and-error involved
- greater freedom to customise/control your model
- more ethical (more on this later...)
