# Image Generation: GANs vs Diffusion Models

Two approaches to generating images with AI.

---
# Diffusion Models

- trained on lots of data (in the millions)
- prompt-driven
- designed to generate _anything_ (although the more novel, the more it's going to 'hallucinate')

---
# Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

- trained on smaller, curated data (< 5000)
- generates new instances of what it has been trained on
- more trial-and-error involved
- greater freedom to customise/control your model
- more ethical
  - or are they...?
